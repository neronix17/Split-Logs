Since Twice [Wood Logs - Table Saw](https://www.nexusmods.com/dinkum/mods/48?) is broken and unusable as of posting, I figured I'd go ahead and remake it for the current version while adding the tin ingot splitting option as that also made sense to me personally.

### Installation
Install following the standard instructions, found here: [Dinkum Wiki | Modding](https://dinkum.fandom.com/wiki/Modding)

### Configuration
- Ensure that you started the game with the SplitLogs.dll plugin at least once to create the configuration file.
- Go to the "Dinkum/BepinEx/Config" folder
- Use a text editor to open "neronix17.dinkum.splitlogs.cfg" file
- Edit the values as desired, they have explanations in the file.
- Launch the game!

Keep in mind that the tin ingots splitting is very exploitable, which is why it's default is set to disabled.
